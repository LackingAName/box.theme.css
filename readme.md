# box.theme.css

so im likee, not a skilled css programmer soooo sorry if it look baadd

here's what gets changed rn:

- discord has a lot of variables dat u can change, like --radius-... are all 0px

- i put a wildcard selector to set the border-radius of everything to 0px and rx to 0 (rx is radius of ellipses on the x-axis)

- this uses the google sans ~~font~~ typeface since it looks wayyy better and is more readable in my honest opinion

- since everything is a box, i had to make status indicators a border and not a lil circle

- display names in voice chats have cool rgb scrolling effect bc y not :)

there's a lot of small things changed that i won't list but u can look at da code if ur curious
